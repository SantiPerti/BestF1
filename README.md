# BestF1
iOS App

## *The best F1 driver in history* calculated through a mathematical model. 

### The results can be obtained over a period of time, a certain season, race, decade...  or all-time history.

The algorithm is mainly based on driver merits when racing against his teammates, taking into account who their teammates are at each moment.
It tries to remove *any* influence of the car or team they are driving for. 

* 1 The algorithm tries to calculate the *absolute importance* of each driver and his weighted average grid positions.

* 2 That number is then used to calculate the relative performance against your teammate; the real measure of your driving skills in equal opportunities.

Most of the times, a F1 World Champion is the best driver on the grid that year, but some other times this result is too much influenced by the car: power, aerodynamics, teamwork, strategies... or even politics and penalties.

Also, the best drivers usually end up signing with the best teams and winning races, but often there are dominance cycles of a team and the rest of the drivers don't have a chance, despite of their great performance.

This app seeks to end up with your bar discussions, troll hunting and answering endless threads alltogether. 
You can then be bored to death and a happier person; you will go back to your coach, take a beer, enjoy your family and friends, do some useful stuff or try to be a good journalist. You are welcome ;-)
